          <strong>The primary goal is to promote resource efficiency, reduce waste, and foster sustainable practices throughout every stage of production and consumption. This involves creating systems that maximize the use of resources, minimize environmental impact, and prioritize renewable, recyclable, or biodegradable materials. Moreover, this initiative seeks to raise awareness of the critical social inequalities that contribute to and exacerbate unsustainable practices. By recognizing and addressing these disparities—such as unequal access to sustainable products, fair wages, and safe working conditions—the approach aims to build a more inclusive, equitable system where the environmental and social well-being of all communities is prioritized. This holistic perspective encourages responsible choices from both producers and consumers, ultimately fostering a culture of sustainability that supports long-term environmental health and social justice.</strong>

          <strong>Nowadays everything is standardized to reduce costs and programmed to be obsolete. The biggest social problems
            that come with this problem are labor exploitation and economic inequality. While companies profit, many workers
            and small-scale producers struggle to meet basic needs this way exacerbating global inequalities and limiting
            access to resources and opportunities for marginalized groups.</strong>

        <h3>Choose sustainable products</h3>
        <p>Opt for goods made from environmentally friendly materials, such as organic, recycled, or biodegradable
            options. Look for certifications like Fair Trade, which ensure that products are ethically produced.</p>

        <h3>Support local and ethical brands:</h3>
        <p>Prioritize buying from businesses that are transparent about their supply chains and who treat their

            economy.</p>
