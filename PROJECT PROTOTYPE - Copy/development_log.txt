Individual (Nahui): I felt really overwhelmed at first when i realized the points we had to be aware before doing this project, but when it came to doing it i felt really inspired by how i can even implement this on my personal projects and portfolio. Personally, i get really motivated on doing front-end, it can be tricky but i always learn and surpass myself

Individual (Sof√≠a): I personally think that even if it is a beta-version, I surpassed myself. I struggled a lot with the crossword. I don't know why we thought it was a good idea, but honestly I learned a lot, really, a lot. At first I was just going to leave it as it was even if it didn't completely work, but I really felt like an ick, so I pushed and finally got it.
Development log: 17-Sep:
We started looking at what we wanted to implement to our page, what we wanted to achieve and to make the readers know.
17-Oct:
We started by coding small bits, mostly trying to figure out how we would do the crossword and adding some changes to the prototype, the layout pretty much stayed the same.

24-Oct:
We didn't do much, except to keep looking at ways to do the cross word and make it look like we want to. We got the layout for the crossword along with words and definitions (clues). We still have the crossword looking like a table instead of a crossword.

29-Oct:
We got the layout like we wanted. Changed colors, added images, animations and information. We changed from html to ejs, installed express and the nodes. We figured out the crossword thing and after a lot of struggle with the word layout, we managed to get it done.
